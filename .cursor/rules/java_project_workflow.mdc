# Java Project Workflow

When I give you a new programming task, please follow this workflow:

1.  **Initialize a new Java project**:
    *   Create the project at the root of the workspace.
    *   The project structure should be similar to existing projects like [praktische-umsetzung](mdc:praktische-umsetzung) and [morse-code-als-baum](mdc:morse-code-als-baum). This typically involves a Maven setup with `src/main/java` and `src/test/java` directories. (This step should be skipped if errors occurred in a previous, related task that prevents a clean start for the new task).

2.  **Implement the solution**:
    *   Code the solution to fulfill all the requirements I provide for the task.
    *   AVOID 'TODO's AT ALL COST; implement the feature as the task provides.

3.  **Test the solution**:
    *   Once the coding is complete, attempt to run the project.
    *   Write and execute tests to verify the functionality.
