# Java Project Workflow

When I give you a new programming task, please follow this workflow:

1.  **Initialize a new Java project**:

    - Create the project at the root of the workspace.
    - The project structure should be similar to existing projects like @prd @mohis typically involves a Maven setup with `src/main/java` and `src/test/java` directories. (This step should be skipped if errors occurred in a previous, related task that prevents a clean start for the new task).

2.  **Implement the solution**:

    - Code the solution to fulfill all the requirements I provide for the task.
    - AVOID 'TODO's AT ALL COST; implement the feature as the task provides.

3.  **Test the solution**:

    - Once the coding is complete, attempt to run the project.
    - Write and execute tests to verify the functionality.

4.  **Document the solution**:
    - Create a new file in the projects directory called `documentation.md`, in which you will create the following:
      - A Mermaid diagram detailing the functions, project structure and classes within the project.
